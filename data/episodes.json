Erika says, Danny and Deshawn are potentially looking for an idol during the water penalty, so it's waving a few red flags for us.

Danny, JD and Xander make their decision, the results of which will be known to them when they enter the voting booth at Tribal Council. Not confident enough to risk his vote and betray his tribe, Danny chooses to protect his, while JD and Xander's choices are not shown. Xander explains, \"The pro to protecting your vote is that at next tribal, you don't have to worry; and the pro to risking your vote is that you have this weapon that can get you out of a sticky situation. What I gleaned instantly from those guys is that they wanna play hard. It's the prisoner's dilemma. You just met these people, but you really don't know how they are gonna respond to something that could benefit them personally. It's a 'high risk, high reward' situation.\" Danny explains his choice to keep his vote: \"If I risk my vote, and I ended up losing, then I would lose my vote at the next Tribal Council, and I don't think the risk was worth the reward. So if JD and Xander decided to risk their vote, they will both have extra votes at Tribal Council.\" JD jokes, \"The best decisions in the history of mankind have inevitably been decided by eenie meenie miney mo.\"",

To invoke the Shot in the Dark, a player must give up their vote upon arriving at the voting booth, insert their die in a container, and reach into a bag full of scrolls, one of which reads \"safe\". The player would then return to their seat and present their chosen scroll to Jeff at the time where he allows a play of a Hidden Immunity Idol. If the player does get the \"safe\" scroll, its effect is similar to that of a Hidden Immunity Idol, negating all votes against the user, resulting in the elimination of the player with the next highest number of votes. After explaining the challenge, as a final twist, Jeff tells the tribes only one tribe will win immunity, sending the two other tribes to Tribal Council with their flints forfeited after the challenge.",
