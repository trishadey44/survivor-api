After looking back on the show's evolution, Jeff decides to let the viewers in on what is happening this time around. He then updates the audience on the new twists, including a package labelled the \" Beware Advantage \", which he plants at the Yase tribe camp, noting that a similar advantage has also been placed at the other tribe camps. Jeff also mentions the new Game Within The Game feature for the viewers to play and somehow feel the Survivor experience.",

            "text": "Yase arrives at their camp, embarrassed by their performance at the Reward Challenge, laughing and hoping their families will skip the first episode. As they enter their beach, they find an hourglass, a triangular frame, and two steel barrels. A note states that for them to earn the supplies they lost from the challenge, they have to choose one of two tasks: \"Savvy\", which requires them to count the number of triangles within the triangle given in one guess, or \"Sweat\" where two members, without any help from their four other tribemates, are to fill up both barrels with water, but the pair may only collect water from the far side of the beach and only have four hours to complete the task. Failure to succeed on either task will result to the tribe not receiving the supplies until after the first Immunity Challenge . Evvie laments, \"It's scary. We need a pot, we need a machete, we need flint. Like, this is a huge, huge, huge decision.\" As the tribe discusses which task to do, it is pointed out the \"Savvy\" task may have triangles that can be easily overlooked, and since the tribe missed a paddle at the Reward Challenge, the tribe agrees to perform \"Sweat\" instead. Voce feels more optimistic at first, as they have multiple people who can work together on the task, thus he will not be singled out from the whole group. Voce says, \"Being a neurosurgeon, you are constantly thinking through scenarios, and I really want the 'savvy' option to be chosen. One of the rules for the physical challenge said only two people can do it and the rest of the tribe goes off, and you would have to be an idiot to do that, because that means you're sequestered from your tribe.\" Voce's fears are realized when Xander offers to try the \"Sweat\" task with him as his partner. Voce expresses his concerns with Xander, stating the task would leave them exhausted, but he gives in and agrees to help him while the rest can build the shelter for them. Unwittingly putting himself in such a strenuous task, an annoyed Voce says, \"I'll look like a little weenie if I'm just like, 'No, no, I don't wanna do it', and so of course I have to say, 'Yeah, I could do that with you. We could get it done. Sure. No problem.' How did I get roped into this, while now these people are gonna go make bonds, hunt for idols as they build the shelter? They're gonna start this game; I'm not starting this game. I'm the moron running along the beach back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Idiot!\"",

            "text": "Back on Luvu, Danny and Deshawn are still doing their task, when they decide they have some spare time to make quick hunts for their tribe's Hidden Immunity Idol . The two of them agree not to tell anyone else if one of them finds it. Talking about their side quest, Danny says, \"I believe me and Deshawn have a pretty strong alliance. We make some deals while we are out here, we're trying to figure out, you know, what we wanna do and how we can move further in this game, and if you're gonna look for an idol, look for it on the first day. Unbeknownst to the two of them, Naseer, who initially came by to check on their progress, catches them looking around the woods instead of finishing their task when the hourglass is already half-empty. Nasser says, \"So, I'm checking on Danny and Deshawn, how the water-carry challenge was going, but I couldn't find them. And then I can see all the way to the end; to me it looks like they were looking for idols. I got a little bit disappointed because I'm the one that said 'There is no strategy until these guys come back'. Then I'm like, okay, they're going behind our back trying to find an idol. One of them has to go. Upset, Naseer expresses his worry to the women they might not have their supplies if the two men keep idol hunting. Surprised, Erika vows to keep an eye on them moving forward. Naseer offers a pitch that if Luvu loses immunity, they keep it simple and vote either Danny or Deshawn out. Erika says, Danny and Deshawn are potentially looking for an idol during the water penalty, so it's waving a few red flags for us. You know, thinking about what can happen the next few rounds, like, those guys could save each other with an idol; all of a sudden, like, they pick off the 'weak' people; then all of us are screwed at that point.\"",

Danny says, \"We took that chance, and worked that hard to get the supplies, so I think it built us a little respect in our tribe.\" While Danny, Heather and Naseer leave to retrieve the supplies from Tree Mail , Sydney informs Deshawn that Naseer caught them looking for the idol. A mad Deshawn states, \"Danny was bustin' ass, I was bustin' ass out there, like, it wasn't easy to do, and damn, you got a lot of nerve to come back and say that two people who just won you a machete need to be voted out. That's insane. I was upset. Immediately, for me, 'Okay, it has to be Naseer', because this is the game he's playing. He has to go.",

The three men later realize the trek is punishing. JD explains, \"I'm an athlete, so I thought I was gonna be fine. That trek had me gassed. But I thank God for giving me this experience, and this is my dream out here. Growing up, I was not always the bro with the long hair and the pretty teeth and the really nice style; I was bullied a lot, because I was short, I was skinny, I had braces, I had glasses. Y'know, I wasn't 'cool'. I always say I grew up more like Carlton Banks than I grew up like Will Smith. Watching Survivor made me feel as though I didn't need to fit into this mold that everybody wants to put me in. The people who I looked up to, the people who I loved to watch, I'm like, 'That's who I wanna be like'. I wanna be like Ozzy , y'know, I wanna be like Woo . And so, that's why I say Survivor built me up, and Survivor helped me become who I am, and without Survivor I wouldn't be this guy; I wouldn't be the guy who loves being out in the jungle; I wouldn't be the guy who on Day 1 of Survivor started fire! I'm the youngest kid out here; it feels incredible! This is who I wanted to be my whole entire life. I'm out here and I'm a Survivor player.\" Danny, JD and Xander finally reach the top of the mountain and spot another sign, telling them to go back down the mountain and separate, after which each will make a private decision before heading back to camp. Each of them comes across with their own ship's wheel with instructions. With the time the three got to get to know each other, they are presented with a prisoner's dilemma : \"Protect\" or \"Risk\" their vote in their first trip to Tribal Council . By unanimously choosing \"Protect\", all three keep their votes, while unanimously choosing \"Risk\" will strip all three of their votes, but if there is a split decision, those who chose \"Protect\" will keep their votes while those who chose \"Risk\" will not only keep their votes, they will also receive an Extra Vote parchment. Danny, JD and Xander make their decision, the results of which will be known to them when they enter the voting booth at Tribal Council. Not confident enough to risk his vote and betray his tribe, Danny chooses to protect his, while JD and Xander's choices are not shown. Xander explains, \"The pro to protecting your vote is that at next tribal, you don't have to worry; and the pro to risking your vote is that you have this weapon that can get you out of a sticky situation. What I gleaned instantly from those guys is that they wanna play hard. It's the prisoner's dilemma. You just met these people, but you really don't know how they are gonna respond to something that could benefit them personally. It's a 'high risk, high reward' situation.\" Danny explains his choice to keep his vote: \"If I risk my vote, and I ended up losing, then I would lose my vote at the next Tribal Council, and I don't think the risk was worth the reward. So if JD and Xander decided to risk their vote, they will both have extra votes at Tribal Council.\" JD jokes, \"The best decisions in the history of mankind have inevitably been decided by eenie meenie miney mo.\"",

            "text": "Before informing the tribes the mechanics of the challenge, Jeff presents a new twist: the Shot in the Dark die, which can be used at Tribal Council as a last resort if a player perceives danger of being voted out with no alternative options left. To invoke the Shot in the Dark, a player must give up their vote upon arriving at the voting booth, insert their die in a container, and reach into a bag full of scrolls, one of which reads \"safe\". The player would then return to their seat and present their chosen scroll to Jeff at the time where he allows a play of a Hidden Immunity Idol. If the player does get the \"safe\" scroll, its effect is similar to that of a Hidden Immunity Idol, negating all votes against the user, resulting in the elimination of the player with the next highest number of votes. After explaining the challenge, as a final twist, Jeff tells the tribes only one tribe will win immunity, sending the two other tribes to Tribal Council with their flints forfeited after the challenge.",

Abraham's answer sounded very fine-tuned, like an experienced player, and Tiffany brings up his speaking skills and how you may not feel you were given a proper answer. Abraham does not argue with Tiffany about what she thought of him, but states he knows what he brings to the tribe. The idea of the Shot in the Dark terrifies Voce, but he also feels it may not be as scary as it appears to be. Liana believes the twist could cause a lot of chaos, as it takes that sliver of power to mess up someone's game.
